Hello! This is a personal project of mine that I work on from time to time. 

It'll mostly serve as a means to show off my programming habits and what my code tends to look like. 

For now, this project is still in development, but feel free to check it out from time to time. This README will be updated at the end of each month to cover all the changes made.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me at adamlb493@gmail.com

CHANGELOG:
Sept 3rd, 2025 - initialized .devcontianer and dependabot, connecting GitHub and Docker to IDE.
